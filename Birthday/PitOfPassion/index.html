                <h2>Happy Birthday Jen!</h2>
                <p style = "    text-indent: 50px;">         Happy 17th birthday, you creative wizkid! Thank you for everything the past 3 years of my life.
                    Whether that be talking about how our day was or plans over the weekend, you always seem to cheer me up with your <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/5UlJd8LYFURsALAOH9pPQK" target="_blank">Unbreakable Smile</a>. 
                    Although, the beginning of this school year was a rough patch considering we didn't have any classes together, we still managed to get through that. 
                    It's been awesome getting to know you more and more each year and I will never forget the Song Thread and watching <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_HReR_McQ" target="_blank">
                    Don't Hug Me I'm Scared with you.</a> 
                    I admire your persistence and resilience through the loads of school work (mostly chemistry) while still managing dance and numerous art projects.
                    Your music taste is amazing and has turned into somewhat of a culture. It's begun to spread from your friends to everyone around you, creating somewhat of a <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/7gjAu1qr5C2grXeQFFOGeh" target="_blank">"Passion Pit"</a>. The
                    original "Awesome Mixes" from 10th grade will always be a memorable moment for me as it truly got me more into music.  
                    <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/0IVHlst3XMgzXUJbIyZ8oO" target="_blank">Without you</a> I wouldn't be the same person I am today and I thank you for that.  You're one of my closest friends and one of the best people here at Shasta. 
                    <u>No one</u> can <u>ever</u> replace you. You are super compassionate towards others and I thank you for always having my back through some of the toughest situations in my life. Keep <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/3w04cXVTLNvkl6foI4K1ze" target="_blank">Pass[ing] the Vibes</a> and I wish you the best for <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/5vBSrE1xujD2FXYRarbAXc" target="_blank">
                    Years & Years</a> to come. <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/2UonPYDoqpUZxoJUHWCgtP" target="_blank">I've Told You Now</a>, how much of an impact you've had on my life and it's been such a <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/2itCTeFaGppUvoxCsuJQhw" target="_blank">Good Thing</a>.
                    You deserve the best in life and have a <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/1HwpWwa6bnqqRhK8agG4RS" target="_blank">Beautiful Soul</a>. <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/0IVHlst3XMgzXUJbIyZ8oO" target="_blank">Without you</a>, life wouldn't be the same.

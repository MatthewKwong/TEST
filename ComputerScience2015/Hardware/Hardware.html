        <div style="font-size:30px"><u>Motherboard:</u>

            <p>A motherboard is the main circut board. Basic circuitry or other parts can be attathed. The motherboard has chips and controllers called chipsets. Other slots of memory can also be incerted. The CPU, ROM, memory RAM expansion slots, and PCI slots are all attatched to the motherboard. The motherboard also includes controllers for the hard drive, USB ports, DVD drvie, keyboard, and mouse.</p>

            <u>CPU:</u>

            <p>The CPU or Central Processing Unit is the brains of the computer where much of the calculations take place in. Many computers have one or more printed circuits. The CPU is an internal component of the computer. The CPU is fairly small and square like shaped. It has many pins and connecters underneath it. The CPU is inserted pin side down on the motherboard.</p>

            <u>RAM:</u>

            <p>RAM or Random Access Memory is a type of memory that can be accessed randomly. RAM can be commonly found in computers, devices, and printers. RAM is the main memory of a computer. For example, a computer with 4MB RAM has 4 million bytes of memory that programs can use. There are also 2 other types of RAM called SRAM, Static Random Access Memory and DRAM, Dynamic Random Access Memory.

            <u>Hard drive:</u>

            <p>The Hard drive stores all of the computer's main data. The hard drive has components such as the header actuator, write head, spindle, awrite actuator arm, and platter. The back of the hard drive has a circut board known as the disk controller. Data can be sent is sent by the disk controller.</p>

            <p>There are also external hard drives which backup data. SSD's or Solid State Drives are becoming much more popular in the modern day. This is because of how fast the program speed, less moving parts that can be damaged, the size is very small making it especially useful increasing the avilable space within a computer, and because there are no moving parts the SSD will not heat up.</p>

            <u>PSU:</u>
            <p>
                PSU or Power Supply Unit is the battery for the computer that powers the computer. The PSU takes the ammount of energy from an outlet using AC (Alternating-Current) electric power and turns it into DC (Direct-Current) electric power in order to power/charge a computer.

            <u>Mouse:</u>
            <p>The mouse is also plugged into the usb port. When the mouse is moved, this motion is translated into motion of a pointer on a monitor or screen, which allows easier control.</p>

        <p>What is the Genius Project? The project is a 15 week time where students pick a project of their choice. This allows students to express their personality and persue their passions in life. The possibilities for this project are endless as it can be changing something in the student's community to improving upon a skill they'd like to improve upon. Over the course of the 15 weeks I have decided to do my Genius Project on,"How to become a better web-designer". Throughout this project I will post the creations I've made on this site.</p>

        <p class="date">March 8 - 14: <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery"target="_blank"> Learning JQuery</a>
        </p>
        <p>During this time I decided to learn a new programming language called JQuery. I originally planned on finishing this lesson in 1 month, but ended up finishing that week.</p>

        <p class="date">March 15 - 21: <a href="https://madam-ramirez.codio.io/DraggableKwongEnt/DraggableKwongEnt.html"target="_blank"> Kwong Enterprises Revision</a>
        </p>
        <p>After learning JQuery I decided to go back to one of my previous projects to add a draggable effect to it. I was also wanting to learn how to insert audio into my site, so I added that as well.
            <a href="https://madam-ramirez.codio.io/K E/KwongEnt.html">Here</a> is the previous site before the added draggable sections and audio.

        </p>
        <p>This was made because I had wanted to make a music player before, but never really knew how. With the time off from school during spring break I decided to look up different functions of Javascript.</p>

        </p>
        <p>I began to research more about animations across this week. I began to make simple little animations using webkit transitions in CSS. Here is an 
            <a href = "https://madam-ramirez.codio.io/Webkit Animation Practice/WebKit.html" target="_blank">example</a>.  Throughout the week I have created this. The beginning of the site has a door like effect where there are borders top, bottom, left, and right sides of the screen expand out. For the content of the page I added some corny jokes.</p>
